The Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality is a specific form of Bell's inequality which is used to test Bell's theorem, which demonstrates that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. A hidden-variable theory is a deterministic model of physics which introduces additional "hidden" variables that cannot be measured to explain quantum phenomena, and local hidden-variable theories satisfy the principle of locality, which requires that distant events cannot influence each other faster than the speed of light, and that their outcomes are statistically independent.

This code uses the Qiskit Aer simulator to experimentally prove the violation of this inequality. This violation confirms that nature cannot be described with local hidden-variable theories and shows that nature is fundamentally non-deterministic and that particles can influence each other instantaneously, regardless of distance.

This code was written for my undergraduate Quantum Mechanics course as an honors project to give me the opportunity to learn Qiskit and the basics of Quantum Information Theory.
