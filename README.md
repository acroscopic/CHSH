The Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality is a specific form of Bell's inequality which is used to test Bell's theorem, which demonstrates that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. A hidden-variable theory is a deterministic model of physics which introduces additional "hidden" variables that cannot be measured to explain quantum phenomena, and local hidden-variable theories satisfy the principle of locality, which requires that distant events cannot influence each other faster than the speed of light, and that their outcomes are statistically independent.

This reposity contains three programs to demonstrate the violation of this inequality. Two of these programs use the Qiskit Aer simulator to experimentally prove the violation. One in a noiseless environment, one in a simulated noisy environment. The final of the three programs run directly on IBM Quantum Hardware.

A full writeup of the experiment can be found at CHSH_Project.pdf

This code was written for my undergraduate Quantum Mechanics course as an honors project to give me the opportunity to learn Qiskit and the basics of Quantum Information Theory.
