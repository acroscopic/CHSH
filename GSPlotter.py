### GSPlotter ###
"""
This module is meant to imported in other programs.
It is a general use plotting software for usage in the GRBA group

Usage:
  With GSPlotter.py in the same folder (or with an absolute path)
  in your program, import GSPlotter as gsp

Call GSPlotter with gsp.plotter(data1, data2, ...)
  with the information you want to plot


Example plot creation:

gsp.plotter(
    x_data=[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]],             # Data for the x-axis
    y_data=[[5,6],[3,4],[1,2]],             # Data for the y-axis
    xlabel='f(x) = 123',                    # Title on the bottom of the plot
    ylabel='f(y) = 456',                    # Title across the side of the plot
    title='plot_title',                     # Title on the top of the plot
    plot_labels=["str1", "str2", "str3"],   # For the legend
    filename='figure.png',                  # Figure file name
    colors=['red','gold','green'],          # Three random colors       *optional*
    line_styles=["-", "--", ":"],           # Three random linestyles   *optional*
    scale='linear'                          # How you view the data     *optional*
)
